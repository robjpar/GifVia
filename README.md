At its basic level, the website users can play multiple games of trivia on a variety of topics while trying to max their score and achieve the top spot on the Previous Players scoreboard.

For each new question they select, they are not only trying to beat the timer, but beat their own mind and not be distracted! A gif related to the topic is generated for each new question. Players are rewarded with a winner gif when they get the answer right and see a sad gif when they’re wrong.

## Features

- Users can “log into” the website with a special nickname and a passcode
- Scores are calculated based on the difficulty of the questions &mdash; questions are loaded in sets of 12 where the first four questions are easy and worth 1 point, the second set of questions are a medium difficulty and worth 2 points, and the last set of questions is worth 3 points and is the highest difficulty
- Users can load more questions on the topic they’re on or go back to the landing page to pick a new topic
- An analysis feature keeps track not only of the most popular categories, but also how many questions were answered right from each of the trivia categories and displays this information in an easy-to-digest graph
